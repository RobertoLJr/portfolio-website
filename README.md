# Day 83 Project: Portfolio Website

## Concept

This repository refers to the 83rd project from my [100-days-of-python](https://github.com/RobertoLJr/100-days-of-python)
repository, and it presents an (almost) fully-fledged portfolio website designed by BootstrapMade. The
backend is intended to be developed with Python, using Flask, but the current implementation is straightforward.

The only functionality not yet implemented is the Contact form and, as such, the Submit button is disabled. Since the
code is publicly available, I chose not to make use of smtplib or other APIs to send emails. This could be
added upon hosting the website somewhere, which might happen in the near future.
